                    I'm a Front End developer with 2 years of experience -- based in Toronto, ON.

                        I believe that working with code is like being a wizard.  instead of a spellbook, I have a box made of refined dinosaur bone that's powered by lightining.

                         By moving my fingers in patterns on the keys, I am able to cast spells limited only by my mind. Web Developer is far too bland a term for something so wonderous.  No -- I'm a Wizard.
