                        Hi my name is Chris, and I am a hybrid bookkeeper and web developer.  I have achieved CGA Level 3, and have over 7 years of experience as a professional bookkeeper.  I have worked with clients ranging in size from small business, to billion-dollar corporate trusts.

                         I am self-taught when it comes to web development, and I've learned various languages like HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Java, C#, Python and PHP. Early on I learned how to use the bootstrap framework with jQuery,and actually used it to make this site.  These days I tend to use React.js because of the performance of the virtual DOM, as well as the modular approach to building web components.

                    Part of how I taught myself to code was through a site called Treehouse -- one of the most popular platforms for learning to code. I am <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/christopherparke" target="_blank"> ranked in the  top 0.0025% (top 1,000 out of 400,000+) of web developers </a> on  Treehouse and continue learning to this day.
